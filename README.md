# CC Application

The purpose of this project is to practice the fundamentals of React. That being: 
- The use of state and props
- Conditional rendering
- The use of hooks
- Splitting up code into more components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
